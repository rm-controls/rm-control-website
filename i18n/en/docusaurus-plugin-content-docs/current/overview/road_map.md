# Road Map
## Documentation
### README
* [x] Why rm-controls?
* [ ] rm-controls 101
* [ ] Gazebo Chassis
* [ ] rm_engineer
* [ ] rm_dbus
* [ ] rm_bringup

### Doxygen 
* [x] rm_hw
* [ x ] rm_calibration_controllers
* [ ] rm_gazebo
* [ ] rm_chassis_controllers
* [ ] rm_gimbal_controllers
* [ ] rm_shooter_controllers

## IO
The major drawback of this project is that the number of IO types is too small, so the corresponding adapter module and the corresponding test interface are developed
### Module to CAN
* [x] HI229 (under test)
* [x] ICM-20948 (under test)
* [ ] BIM-88
* [ ] GPIO

### Module to i2c to USB
With the [I2C-Tiny-USB](https://github.com/harbaum/I2C-Tiny-USB) project, whose driver is supported by the Linux mainline, it is very easy to get the i2c interface and use the I2C/SMBus subsystem.
* [x] pcf8574 GPIO extension (under test)
* [x] pca9685 PWM extension (under test)
* [ ] ICM-20948
